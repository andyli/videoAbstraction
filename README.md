This is the source code of my submission to an assignment of SM3603 Interactivity I, offered by the School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong, back in 2009.

The idea of video abstraction is based on the paper:

 * [Real-Time Video Abstraction](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1142018)


Dependencies included in this repo:

 * [async-threading](https://code.google.com/p/async-threading/)
 * [Resizable Wrapper component](http://dougmccune.com/blog/2007/08/17/my-360flex-slides-and-code/)

Videos files were taken from somewhere which I forget. Let me know if there is any copyright issue.
